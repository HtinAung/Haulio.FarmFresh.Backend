# Haulio.FarmFresh.Backend



Here what i have finished:
- Customer API = Used to get products, purchased and also view order histories
- Store API = Used to create store, manage store, add products, update products, delete products and view other people's order histories
- IdentityServer4 = Used to authenticate and authorize the flows
- Ocelot API Gateway = Acts as api gateway for both api endpoints
- Customer Web App = The UI for Customer API.
- (not yet implement) => Store Web App

I also have created default account for testing:
- Customer Account: (ghulamcyber@hotmail.com, password: @Future30)
-  Store Account: (raraanjani@gmail.com, password: @Future30)
